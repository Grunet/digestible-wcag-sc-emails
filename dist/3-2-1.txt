 3.2 - PREDICTABLE
ON FOCUS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

When any user interface component receives focus, it does not initiate a change
of context. 

These websites...

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Example 1: A dropdown menu 

A dropdown menu on a page allows users to choose between jump destinations. If
the person uses the keyboard to move down to a choice and activates it (with a
spacebar or enter key) it will jump to a new page. However, if the person moves
down to a choice and either hits the escape or the tab key to move out of the
pulldown menu â€“ it does not jump to a new screen as the focus shifts out of the
dropdown menu. 

I still don't really understand
