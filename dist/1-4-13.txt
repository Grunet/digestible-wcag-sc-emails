 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
CONTENT ON HOVER OR FOCUS(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers
additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

Dismissible A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without
moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content
communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; 
Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer
can be moved over the additional content without the additional content
disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover
or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no
longer valid. Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is
controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background. 

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLE 2: HOVERABLE TOOLTIP
Screenshot of a button with a large mouse pointer over it, and a tooltip displayed  below the button which is obscured by the large pointer [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/button-pointer-on-tooltip.png]Screenshot of a button with a tooltip below it, and a large mouse pointer at the bottom of the tooltip [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/button-pointer-below-tooltip.png]
Figure 3A button's tooltip is displayed directly below it on mouse hover which
can easily be obscured by a large pointer. The tooltip itself is able to be
hovered so the mouse pointer can be moved down to its bottom edge in order to
view the tooltip text.

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
