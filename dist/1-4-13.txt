CONTENT ON HOVER OR FOCUS(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers
additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

Dismissible A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without
moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content
communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content; 
Hoverable If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer
can be moved over the additional content without the additional content
disappearing; Persistent The additional content remains visible until the hover
or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no
longer valid. Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is
controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLE 1: DISMISSABLE TOOLTIP
Screenshot of a button with a mouse pointer over it, and a tooltip displayed  below the button [img/button-pointer-tooltip.png]Screenshot of a button with a mouse pointer over it, and no tooltip [img/button-pointer.png]
 Figure 1A tooltip is displayed below a LVTF button on hover so as not to
obscure the button itself. It does however obscure content below the button (the
next red button, called ~comment-zoom-content). To meet the Dismissible
requirement, a user can press the Escape key to clear the tooltip without moving
the mouse, as demonstrated in the second image. Screenshot of a button with a focus indicator on it, and no tooltip [img/button-focus-indicator.png]
 Figure 2The button's tooltip also appears on focus and can be removed with the
Escape key. The screen shot shows the same LVTF button with focus, but the
tooltip has been dismissed and is no longer visible. I still don't really
understand
