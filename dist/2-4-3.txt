 2.4 - NAVIGABLE
FOCUS ORDER(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

If a Web page can be navigated sequentially and the navigation sequences affect
meaning or operation, focusable components receive focus in an order that
preserves meaning and operability.

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
An HTML Web page is created with the left hand navigation occurring in the HTML
after the main body content, and styled with CSS to appear on the left hand side
of the page. This is done to allow focus to move to the main body content first
without requiring tabIndex attributes or JavaScript. 

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
