WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Suggestions from a Limited Set of Values 

 An input field requires that a month name be entered. If the user enters "12,"
suggestions for correction may include 

 * A list of the acceptable values, e.g., "Choose one of: January, February,
   March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November,
   December." 
 * A description of the set of values, e.g., "Please provide the name of the
   month."
 * The conversion of the input data interpreted as a different month format,
   e.g., "Do you mean 'December'?"
