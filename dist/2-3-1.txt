 ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ ‌ 2.3 - SEIZURES AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS
THREE FLASHES OR BELOW THRESHOLD(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one
second period, or the flash is below the general flash and red flash thresholds. 

These websites...

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical
reactions.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A Web site has video of muzzle flash of machine gun fire, but limits the size of
the flashing image to a small portion of the screen below the flash threshold
size. I still don't really understand
