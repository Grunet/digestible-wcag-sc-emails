WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Science information that requires a reading ability at the lower secondary
education level. 

The text below (116 words total) requires a reading ability of grade 4.2 in the
United States according to the Flesch-Kincaid formula. In the US, grade 4.2 is
at the primary education level. 

Science is about testing — and about looking closely. Some scientists use
microscopes to take a close look. We're going to use a simple piece of paper. 

Here's what you do: Print this page and cut out the square to make a "window"
one inch square. (It's easiest to fold the page in half before you cut.) 

Choose something interesting: a tree trunk, a leaf, flower, the soil surface, or
a slice of soil from a shovel. 

Put your window over the thing and look at it closely. Take your time — this is
not a race. 

To help you see more details, draw a picture of what's inside your square.

Now let's think about what you've found.
