On accessible websites...

For moving, blinking, scrolling, or auto-updating information, all of the
following are true: 

Moving, blinking, scrolling For any moving, blinking or scrolling information
that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is
presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to
pause, stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of
an activity where it is essential; and 

Auto-updating For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically
and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for
the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update
unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 A form prompt 

A form blinks an arrow near the submit button if a user finishes filling out the
form but does not activate the submit button. The blinking stops after 5
seconds.
