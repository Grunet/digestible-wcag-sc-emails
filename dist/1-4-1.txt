 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
USE OF COLOR(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating
an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 An examination. 

Students view an SVG image of a chemical compound and identify the chemical
elements present based both on the colors used, as well as numbers next to each
element. A legend shows the color and number for each type of element. Sighted
users who cannot perceive all the color differences can still understand the
image by relying on the numbers. 

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
