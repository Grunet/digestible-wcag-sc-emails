USE OF COLOR(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating
an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Disabled Form elements. 

Form elements which are disabled via markup or scripting, are greyed out and
made inactive by the user agent. When in the disabled state these elements do
not receive focus. Assistive technologies can programmatically determine the
state of disabled elements and will provide this information to the user as the
elements are encountered on the page. The change in color and loss of focus
provides redundant, visual information about the state of the control. 

I still don't really understand
