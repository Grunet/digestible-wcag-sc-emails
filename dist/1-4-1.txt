 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
USE OF COLOR(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating
an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background. 

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A form contains both required and optional fields. Instructions at the top of
the form explain that required fields are labeled with red text and also with an
icon. Users who cannot perceive the difference between the optional field labels
and the red labels for the required fields will still be able to see the icon
next to the red labels. Iâ€™d like to know a little more
