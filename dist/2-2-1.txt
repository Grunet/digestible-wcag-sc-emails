 2.2 - ENOUGH TIME
TIMING ADJUSTABLE(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is
true:

Turn off The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering it;
or

Adjust The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over
a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or 

Extend The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to
extend the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"),
and the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or 

Real-time Exception The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for
example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or 

Essential Exception The time limit is essential and extending it would
invalidate the activity; or 

20 Hour Exception The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

These websites...

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A Web site uses a client side time limit to help protect users who may step away
from their computer. After a period of inactivity the Web page asks if the user
needs more time. If it doesn't get a response â€“ it times out. I still don't
really understand
