When user interface components have keyboard focus, all of the following are
true:

 * Contrasting area: There is an area of the focus indicator that has a contrast
   ratio of at least 4.5:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused
   states.
 * Minimum area: The contrasting area is at least double the area of a 1 CSS
   pixel perimeter of the unfocused component;
 * Not obscured: No part of the focus indicator is hidden by author-created
   content.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLES
The examples of this success criterion are similar to Focus Appearance
(Minimum).

 * When links receive focus, an outline is displayed around the link that
   contrasts with the background adjacent to the link. 
 * When buttons receive focus, and outline is displayed within the button
   (around the text) that contrasts with the button’s background. 
 * When text fields receive focus, an outline is displayed around the field,
   indicating that the input has focus. 
 * When radio buttons receive focus, an outline is displayed around the control,
   indicating that the input has focus.
