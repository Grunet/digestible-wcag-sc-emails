 2.1 - KEYBOARD ACCESSIBLE
CHARACTER KEY SHORTCUTS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including
upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then
at least one of the following is true:

Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is
available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard
keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user
interface component is only active when that component has focus. These
websites...

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
ALTERNATE CONTROL
Keyboard-only users are in a long issues thread. While reading the thread they
accidentally hit the S key, which moves focus to the search bar at the top of
the document. This causes them to lose their place and train of thought.
However, a mechanism is provided to allow users to change character-key
shortcuts. They change the shortcut to include another key so they can avoid
future interruptions.

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
