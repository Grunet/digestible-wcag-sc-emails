 2.1 - KEYBOARD ACCESSIBLE
CHARACTER KEY SHORTCUTS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

If a keyboard shortcut is implemented in content using only letter (including
upper- and lower-case letters), punctuation, number, or symbol characters, then
at least one of the following is true:

Turn off A mechanism is available to turn the shortcut off; Remap A mechanism is
available to remap the shortcut to include one or more non-printable keyboard
keys (e.g., Ctrl, Alt); Active only on focus The keyboard shortcut for a user
interface component is only active when that component has focus. These
websites...

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
ALTERNATE CONTROL
A keyboard-only user is in a long issues thread. While reading the thread she
accidentally hits the S key, which moves focus to the search bar at the top of
the document. This causes her to lose her place and her train of thought.
However, a mechanism is provided to allow users to change character-key
shortcuts. She changes the shortcut to include another key so she can avoid
future interruptions. 

I still don't really understand
