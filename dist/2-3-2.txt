 2.3 - SEIZURES AND PHYSICAL REACTIONS
THREE FLASHES(LEVEL AAA)
On accessible websites...

Web pages do not contain anything that flashes more than three times in any one
second period. 

These websites...

Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures or physical
reactions.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A movie with a scene involving very bright lightning flashes is edited so that
the lightning only flashes three times in any one second period. Iâ€™d like to
know a little more
