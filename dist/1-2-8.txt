WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Example 1. alternative for time-based media for a training video 

A community center purchases a Training video for use by its clients and puts it
on the center's intranet. The video involves explaining use of a new technology
and has a person talking and showing things at the same time. The community
center provides an alternative for time-based media that all clients, including
those who can neither see the demonstrations nor hear the explanations in the
synchronized media, can use to better understand what is being presented.
