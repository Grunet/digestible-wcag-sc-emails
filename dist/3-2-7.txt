 3.2 - PREDICTABLE
VISIBLE CONTROLS(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

[New]

Where receiving pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers user interface
components to be visible, information needed to identify that user interface
components are available is visible, except when:

 * The information needed to identify the user interface components is available
   through an equivalent component that is visible on the same page or on a
   different step in a multi-step process without requiring pointer hover or
   keyboard focus;
 * The component is provided specifically to enhance the experience for keyboard
   navigation;
 * A mechanism is available to make the information persistently visible;
 * Hiding the information needed to identify the component is essential.

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
Visible access to email controls: When viewing a list of emails the controls
needed to delete or forward the email are not visible unless hovered. When an
email has been selected the same controls are persistently visible. Iâ€™d like to
know a little more
