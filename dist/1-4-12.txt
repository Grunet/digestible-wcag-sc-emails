 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
TEXT SPACING(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

In content implemented using markup languages that support the following text
style properties, no loss of content or functionality occurs by setting all of
the following and by changing no other style property:

 * Line height (line spacing) to at least 1.5 times the font size;
 * Spacing following paragraphs to at least 2 times the font size;
 * Letter spacing (tracking) to at least 0.12 times the font size;
 * Word spacing to at least 0.16 times the font size.

Exception: Human languages and scripts that do not make use of one or more of
these text style properties in written text can conform using only the
properties that exist for that combination of language and script.

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLES
When spacing is be overridden to the SC's metrics:

 1. Text fits within the bounds of its containing box without being cut off.
 2. Text fits within the bounds of its containing box without overlapping other
    boxes.
