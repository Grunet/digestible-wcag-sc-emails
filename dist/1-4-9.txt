 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
IMAGES OF TEXT (NO EXCEPTION)(LEVEL AAA)
On accessible websites...

Images of text are only used for pure decoration or where a particular
presentation of text is essential to the information being conveyed. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background. 

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A Web page contains a quote. The quote itself is presented as italicized text,
indented from the left margin. The name of the person to whom the quote is
attributed is below the quote with 1.5x the line space and further indented from
the left margin. CSS is used to position the text; set the spacing between
lines; as well as display the text's font family, size, color and decoration. 
Iâ€™d like to know a little more
