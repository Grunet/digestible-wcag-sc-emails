 2.4 - NAVIGABLE
MULTIPLE WAYS(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

More than one way is available to locate a Web page within a set of Web pages
except where the Web Page is the result of, or a step in, a process. 

These websites...

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A local hair salon has created a Web site to promote its services. The site
contains only five Web pages. There are links on each Web page to sequentially
move forward or backward through the Web pages. In addition, each Web page
contains a list of links to reach each of the other Web pages. Iâ€™d like to know
a little more
