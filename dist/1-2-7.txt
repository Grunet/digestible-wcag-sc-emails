WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
Example 1. Video of a lecture. A physics professor is giving a lecture. He makes
freehand sketches on the whiteboard, speaking rapidly as he draws. As soon as he
has finished discussing one problem, he erases the drawing and makes another
sketch while continuing to speak and gesture with his other hand. The video is
paused between problems, and extended audio description of the professor's
drawings and gestures is provided; the video is then resumed. I still don't
really understand
