programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be
presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.

These websites...

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive
technologies.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
STATUS MESSAGE EXAMPLES
 * After a user presses a Search button, the page content is updated to include
   the results of the search, which are displayed in a section below the Search
   button. The change to content also includes the message "5 results returned"
   near the top of this new content. This text is given an appropriate role for
   a status message. A screen reader announces, "Five results returned".
 * After a user presses an Add to Shopping Cart button, a section of content
   near the Shopping Cart icon adds the text "5 items". A screen reader
   announces "Five items" or "Shopping cart, five items".
 * After a user enters incorrect text in an input called Postal Code, a message
   appears above the input reading "Invalid entry". The screen reader announces,
   "Invalid entry" or "Postal code, invalid entry".
 * After a user activates a process, an icon symbolizing 'busy' appears on the
   screen. The screen reader announces "application busy". 
 * An application displays a progressbar to indicate the status of an upgrade.
   The element is assigned a suitable role. The screen reader provides
   intermittent announcements of the progress. 
 * After a user submits a form, text is added to the existing form which reads,
   "Your form was successfully submitted." The screen reader announces the same
   message.
 * After a user unsuccessfully fills in a form because some of the data is in
   the incorrect format, text is added to the existing form which reads "5
   errors on page". The screen reader announces the same message.
 * After a user puts a photo in an album in an online photo app, a snackbar
   [https://material.io/design/components/snackbars.html#] displays the message
   "Saved in 'Wedding' album", which is also read by a screen reader.
