programmatically determined through role or properties such that they can be
presented to the user by assistive technologies without receiving focus.

These websites...

Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, including assistive
technologies.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
STATUS MESSAGE EXAMPLES
 1. After a user presses a Search button, the page content is updated to include
    the results of the search, which are displayed in a section below the Search
    button. The change to content also includes the message "5 results returned"
    near the top of this new content. This text is given an appropriate role for
    a status message. A screen reader announces, "Five results returned". 
 2. After a user presses an Add to Shopping Cart button, a section of content
    near the Shopping Cart icon adds the text "5 items". A screen reader
    announces "Five items" or "Shopping cart, five items". 
 3. After a user enters incorrect text in an input called Postal Code, a message
    appears above the input reading "Invalid entry". The screen reader
    announces, "Invalid entry" or "Postal code, invalid entry". 
 4. After a user activates a process, an icon symbolizing 'busy' appears on the
    screen. The screen reader announces "application busy". 
 5. An application displays a progressbar to indicate the status of an upgrade.
    The element is assigned a suitable role. The screen reader provides
    intermittent announcements of the progress. 
 6. After a user submits a form, text is added to the existing form which reads,
    "Your form was successfully submitted." The screen reader announces the same
    message. 
 7. After a user unsuccessfully fills in a form because some of the data is in
    the incorrect format, text is added to the existing form which reads "5
    errors on page". The screen reader announces the same message. 
 8. After a user puts a photo in an album in an online photo app, a snackbar
    [https://material.io/design/components/snackbars.html#] displays the message
    "Saved in 'Wedding' album", which is also read by a screen reader.
