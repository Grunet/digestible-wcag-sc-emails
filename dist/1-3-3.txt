SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely
on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual
location, orientation, or sound. 

These websites...

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler
layout) without losing information or structure.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Example 1: A schedule of competitive events uses color and shape to distinguish
the time of each event 

A table presents a list of times across the top row and a list of events in the
first vertical column. The cell corresponding to the time of a particular event
has a specific background color and diamond shaped glyph so it can be identified
by color and shape. 

I still don't really understand
