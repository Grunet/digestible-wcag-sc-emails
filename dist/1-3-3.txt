 1.3 - ADAPTABLE
SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely
on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual
location, orientation, or sound. 

These websites...

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler
layout) without losing information or structure.

A table presents a list of times across the top row and a list of events in the
first vertical column and instructions are provided under the table: "Events
marked with a blue diamond are played on field A and events marked with a green
circle are played on field B." The instructions rely on color and shape only and
result in a failure of this criterion. Iâ€™d like to know a little more
