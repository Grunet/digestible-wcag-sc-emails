 1.3 - ADAPTABLE
SENSORY CHARACTERISTICS(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely
on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual
location, orientation, or sound. 

These websites...

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler
layout) without losing information or structure.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 Example 2: An online multi-page survey 

An online multi-page survey uses a link implemented as a green arrow icon placed
in the lower right hand corner of the content to move from one survey page to
the next. The arrow is clearly labeled with "Next" and the instructions state,
"To move to the next section of the survey, select the green arrow icon labeled
'Next' in the lower right corner below the last survey question." The
instruction uses positioning and color to help identify the icon; the
instruction does not rely on these sensory characteristics since it also refers
to the label, so it passes this criterion. 

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
