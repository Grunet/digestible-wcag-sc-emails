 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
AUDIO CONTROL(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

If any audio on a Web page plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, either a
mechanism is available to pause or stop the audio, or a mechanism is available
to control audio volume independently from the overall system volume level. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
An audio file begins playing automatically when a page is opened. However, the
audio can be stopped by the user by selecting a "silent" link at the top of the
page. I still don't really understand
