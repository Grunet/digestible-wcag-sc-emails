NO KEYBOARD TRAP(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

If keyboard focus can be moved to a component of the page using a keyboard
interface, then focus can be moved away from that component using only a
keyboard interface, and, if it requires more than unmodified arrow or tab keys
or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving
focus away.

Make all functionality available from a keyboard.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 A modal dialog box 

A Web application brings up a dialog box. At the bottom of the dialog are two
buttons, Cancel and OK. When the dialog has been opened, focus is trapped within
the dialog; tabbing from the last control in the dialog takes focus to the first
control in the dialog. The dialog is dismissed by activating the Cancel button
or the OK button.
