 2.4 - NAVIGABLE
FOCUS NOT OBSCURED (MINIMUM)(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

[New]

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A page has a sticky footer (attached to the bottom of the viewport). When
tabbing down the page the focused item is not completely visually obscured by
the footer because content in the viewport scrolls up to always display the item
with keyboard focus using scroll padding

know a little more
