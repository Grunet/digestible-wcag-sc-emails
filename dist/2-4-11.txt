[New]

When user interface components receive keyboard focus, all of the following are
true:

 * Contrasting area: There is an area of the focus indicator that has a contrast
   ratio of at least 3:1 between the colors in the focused and unfocused states.
 * Minimum area: The contrasting area is at least as large as:  * Outline: the area of a 1 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused
      component, or
    * Shape: the area of a 4 CSS pixel thick line along the shortest side of a
      minimum bounding box of the unfocused component, and no thinner than 2 CSS
      pixels.
   
   
 * Adjacent contrast: The contrasting area also has a contrast ratio of least
   3:1 against adjacent colors in the focused component, or the contrasting area
   has a thickness of at least 2 CSS pixels.
 * Not fully obscured: The item with focus is not entirely hidden by
   author-created content.
