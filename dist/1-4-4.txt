RESIZE TEXT(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

Except for captions and images of text, text can be resized without assistive
technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or functionality. 

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A user with vision impairments increases the text size on a Web page in a
browser from 1 em to 1.2 ems. While the user could not read the text at the
smaller size, she can read the larger text. All the information on the page is
still displayed when the larger font is used for the text. I still don't really
understand
