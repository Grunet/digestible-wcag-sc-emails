The visual presentation of the following have a contrast ratio of at least 3:1

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
PIE CHARTS
Pie charts make a good case study for the graphical objects part of this success
criterion, the following pie charts are intended to convey the proportion of
market share each browser has. Please Note: The actual figures are made up,
these are not actual market shares. 

Failing pie chart [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_fail.png]
 Figure 11 Fail: The pie chart has labels for each slice (so passes 1.4.1 Use of Color),
but in order to understand the proportions of the slices you must discern the
edges of the slices (the graphical objects conveying essential information), and
the contrast between the slices is not 3:1 or greater. 

Not applicable pie chart [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_na.png]
 Figure 12 Not applicable: The pie chart has visible labels and values that convey
equivalent information to the graphical objects (the pie slices). 

Passing pie chart [https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/img/graphics-contrast_pie-chart_pass.png]
 Figure 13 Pass: The pie chart has visible labels, and sufficient contrast around and
between the slices of the pie chart (the graphical objects). A darker border has
been added around the yellow slice in order to achieve the contrast level.
