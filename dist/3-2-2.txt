 3.2 - PREDICTABLE
ON INPUT(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

Changing the setting of any user interface component does not automatically
cause a change of context unless the user has been advised of the behavior
before using the component.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
A form contains fields representing US phone numbers. All of the numbers have a
three digit area code followed by a three digit prefix and finally a four digit
number, and each part of the phone number is entered into a separate field. When
the user completes the entry of one field the focus automatically moves to the
next field of the phone number. This behavior of phone fields is described for
the user at the beginning of the form. Iâ€™d like to know a little more
