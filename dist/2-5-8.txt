 2.5 - INPUT MODALITIES
TARGET SIZE (MINIMUM)(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

[New]

The size of the target for pointer inputs is at least 24 by 24 CSS pixels,
except where:

 * Spacing: Undersized targets (those less than 24 by 24 CSS pixels) are
   positioned so that if a 24 CSS pixel diameter circle is centered on the
   bounding box of each, the circles do not intersect another target or the
   circle for another undersized target;
 * Equivalent: The function can be achieved through a different control on the
   same page that meets this criterion;
 * Inline: The target is in a sentence or its size is otherwise constrained by
   the line-height of non-target text;
 * User agent control: The size of the target is determined by the user agent
   and is not modified by the author;
 * Essential: A particular presentation of the target is essential or is legally
   required for the information being conveyed.

Make it easier for users to operate functionality through various inputs beyond
keyboard.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
Three buttons are on-screen and the target size of each button is 24 by 24 CSS
pixels. Since the target size itself is 24 by 24 CSS pixels, no additional
spacing is required, the Success Criterion passes. Iâ€™d like to know a little
more
