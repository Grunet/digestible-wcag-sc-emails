 1.3 - ADAPTABLE
ORIENTATION(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display
orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display
orientation is essential.

These websites...

Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler
layout) without losing information or structure.
