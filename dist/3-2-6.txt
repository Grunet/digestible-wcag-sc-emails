 3.2 - PREDICTABLE
CONSISTENT HELP(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

[New]

For each web page within a set of web pages that provides one or more of the
following ways of finding help, access to at least one form of help is included
in the same relative order on each page:

 * Human contact details;
 * Human contact mechanism;
 * Self-help option;
 * A fully automated contact mechanism.

These websites...

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
On-line job application - Some of the application questions may be hard for new
job seekers to understand even after reading the contextual help. For example,
the form may request their identification number, but they may have several and
not know which one to enter. Easily findable contact information will enable
them to use phone or email so they can get an answer to their question. I still
don't really understand
