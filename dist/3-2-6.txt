 3.2 - PREDICTABLE
CONSISTENT HELP(LEVEL A)
On accessible websites...

[New]

If a Web page contains any of the following help mechanisms, and those
mechanisms are repeated on multiple Web pages within a set of Web pages, they
occur in the same order relative to other page content, unless a change is
initiated by the user:

 * Human contact details;
 * Human contact mechanism;
 * Self-help option;
 * A fully automated contact mechanism.

These websites...

Make Web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
On-line job application: Some of the application questions may be hard for new
job seekers to understand even after reading the contextual help. For example,
the form may request their identification number, but they may have several and
not know which one to enter. Consistently located contact information will
enable them to use phone or email so they can get an answer to their question. 
Iâ€™d like to know a little more
