[New]

A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle)
is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step
provides at least one of the following:

Alternative Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive
function test. Mechanism A mechanism is available to assist the user in
completing the cognitive function test. These websites...

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLES
The examples of this Success Criterion are very similar to the Accessible
Authentication (Minimum) [accessible-authentication-minimum.html#examples] 
examples.

 * A web site uses a properly marked up username (or email) and password fields
   as the login authentication (meeting Success Criterion 1.3.5 Input Purpose
   [identify-input-purpose] and Success Criterion 4.1.2: Name, Role, Value
   [name-role-value]). The user's browser or integrated third-party password
   manager extension can identify the purpose of the inputs and automatically
   fill in the username and password.
 * A web site does not block paste functionality. The user is able to use a
   third-party password manager to store credentials, copy them, and paste them
   directly into a login form.
 * A web site uses WebAuthn so the user can authenticate with their device
   instead of username/password. The user's device could use any available
   modality. Common methods on laptops and phones are facial-scan, fingerprint,
   and PIN (Personal Identification Number). The web site is not enforcing any
   particular use; it is assumed a user will set up a method that suits them.
 * A web site offers the ability to login with a third-party provider using the
   OAuth method.
 * A web site that requires two-factor authentication allows for multiple
   options for the 2nd factor, including a USB-based method where the user
   simply presses a button to enter a time-based token.
 * A web site that requires two-factor authentication displays a QR code which
   can be scanned by an app on a user's device to confirm identity.
 * A web site that requires two-factor authentication sends a notification to a
   user's device. The user must use their device's authentication mechanism (for
   example, user-defined PIN, fingerprint, facial recognition) to confirm
   identity.
