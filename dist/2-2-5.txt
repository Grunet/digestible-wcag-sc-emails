 2.2 - ENOUGH TIME
RE-AUTHENTICATING(LEVEL AAA)
On accessible websites...

When an authenticated session expires, the user can continue the activity
without loss of data after re-authenticating. 

These websites...

Provide users enough time to read and use content.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 A shopping site checkout 

A user with extremely limited use of the hands is logged into a shopping site.
It takes so long to enter credit card information into the application that a
time limit occurs while the user is performing the checkout process. When the
user returns to the checkout process and submits the form, the site returns a
login screen to re-authenticate. After the user logs in, the check out process
is restored with the same information and at the same stage. The user did not
lose any data because the server had temporarily accepted and stored the
submission even though the session had timed out and restored the user to the
same state after re-authentication was completed. 

I still don't really understand
