 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
REFLOW(LEVEL AA)
On accessible websites...

Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and
without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

 * Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;
 * Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels.

Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage
or meaning.

These websites...

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
EXAMPLE 1: RESPONSIVE DESIGN
 Animation of zooming in on a responsive site. The content reflows to fit the
screen. 

Note that as the zoom percentage increases, the navigation changes first to hide
options behind a "More" dropdown menu. As zooming continues, most navigation
options are eventually behind a "hamburger" menu button. All the information and
functionality is still available from this web page. There is no horizontal
scrolling. 

Iâ€™d like to know a little more
