WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 A quote 

A Web page contains a quote. The quote itself is presented as italicized text,
indented from the left margin. The name of the person to whom the quote is

the left margin. CSS is used to position the text; set the spacing between
lines; as well as display the text's font family, size, color and decoration.
