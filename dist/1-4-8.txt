 1.4 - DISTINGUISHABLE
VISUAL PRESENTATION(LEVEL AAA)
On accessible websites...

For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to
achieve the following: 

 * Foreground and background colors can be selected by the user.
 * Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK).
 * Text is not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins).
 * Line spacing (leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and
   paragraph spacing is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing.
 * Text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way
   that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text
   on a full-screen window.

Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separating foreground
from background.
