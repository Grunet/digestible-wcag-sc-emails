 For the visual presentation of blocks of text, a mechanism is available to
achieve the following: * Foreground and background colors can be selected by the
user. * Width is no more than 80 characters or glyphs (40 if CJK). * Text is not
justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). * Line spacing
(leading) is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing
is at least 1.5 times larger than the line spacing. * Text can be resized
without assistive technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require
the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window.
