link text alone, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to
users in general.

Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

WHAT'S AN EXAMPLE?
 A list of book titles 

A list of books is available in three formats: HTML, PDF, and mp3 (a recording
of a person reading the book). The title of the book is followed by links to the
different formats. The rendered text for each link is just the format type, but
the text associated with each link includes the title as well as the format; for
instance, "Gulliver's Travels, MP3." 

I still don't really understand
